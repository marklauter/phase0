# Structuring contexts

Structural contract for bounded context documents. Defines the artifact shape for both reading and writing context files. Load when writing or reviewing bounded context documents.

Context files live at `contexts/{nn}-{slug}.md` within the model directory. `{nn}` is a zero-padded number (e.g., `01`, `02`) that provides stable ordering. One file per bounded context.

## Structure

```markdown
# {Title}

## Purpose

{One paragraph. What this bounded context owns — the region of the domain it governs. State the semantic boundary, the core responsibility, and any key preconditions or exclusions that distinguish this context from adjacent ones.}

## Ubiquitous language

{Terms with precise meaning within this context. Each term exists here because it means something specific that may differ from the same word in another context.}

- **{Term}** — {What it means within this context.}

## Use cases

{Use cases that live in this context. Each entry is a relative markdown link followed by a short description.}

- [{Use case name}](../use-cases/{nn}-{slug}.md) — {What the use case achieves, in one sentence.}

## Events produced

{Domain events this context emits. The meaningful state transitions that other contexts may react to.}

- [{EventName}](../events/{nn}-{slug}.md) — {When it occurs and what it signifies.}

## Events consumed

{Domain events this context reacts to. Events produced by other contexts that trigger or inform behavior here.}

- [{EventName}](../events/{nn}-{slug}.md) — {What this context does in response.}

## Integration points

{How this context relates to other contexts. Three relationship types: requires, feeds, shares with.}

- **Requires:** [{Context name}](../contexts/{nn}-{slug}.md) — {What must be in place and why.}
- **Feeds:** [{Context name}](../contexts/{nn}-{slug}.md) — {What this context provides and why the other context needs it.}
- **Shares with:** [{Context name}](../contexts/{nn}-{slug}.md) — {What is shared and the protocol that governs it.}

## Notes

- {Design decisions, open questions, cross-references to actors or invariants.}
