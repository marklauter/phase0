# Mapping contexts

Deep principles for bounded context discovery. Builds on the shared vocabulary in grounding-models.

## Bounded contexts over shared models

Each use case lives in a bounded context with its own language and its own rules. Proofread and resolve share a published language (the issue body protocol) but operate independently. Each operates on its own internal state.

Respect boundaries. Define protocols at every crossing point.
