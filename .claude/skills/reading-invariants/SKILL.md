name: reading-invariants
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "read an invariant", "review an invariant", "check what rules apply", "understand the constraints", or when an agent needs to understand the structure of invariant files. Loads the structural contract for invariant documents.

Read the form at `.claude/contracts/forms/invariant.md` when you need to verify structure.

## Reading invariants

Shared invariants live at `invariants/` within the model directory, with an `index.md` catalog. Single-use invariants stay local to their use case's Invariants section.

- **Start with the index** — `invariants/index.md` lists shared invariants with their scope. Read the index to understand which rules span multiple use cases.
- **Check use cases too** — local invariants only appear in individual use case files. To find all invariants governing an interaction, read both the shared invariants index and the specific use case's Invariants section.
- **Scope** — lists every use case the invariant governs. Use this to understand the invariant's reach.
- **Origin** — names the use case or design decision that established the invariant. Use this to trace why the rule exists.
