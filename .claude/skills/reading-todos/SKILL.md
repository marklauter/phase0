name: reading-todos
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "read a todo", "review todos", "check what work is pending", "see open work items", or when an agent needs to understand the structure of todo files. Loads the structural contract for todo documents.

Read the form at `.claude/contracts/forms/todo.md` when you need to verify structure.

## Reading todos

Todos live at `todos/` within the model directory. No index, no ordering. They are ephemeral — they exist only while the work is pending.

- **List** — `ls todos/` within the model directory. The slug names the action (e.g., `stub-historian-actor.md`, `revise-populate-scenario-3.md`).
- **What and Why** — the What section describes the work. The Why section explains what surfaced the gap. Together they provide enough context to pick up the work without re-reading the source conversation.
- **References** — cross-links to the artifacts this todo touches. Use these to understand what will change when the work is done.
- **Absence is completion** — when a todo is done, it gets deleted. An empty `todos/` directory means all captured work has been addressed.
