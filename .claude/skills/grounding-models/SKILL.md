name: grounding-models
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "model a domain", "define goals and drives", "explain the modeling vocabulary", or when any agent in the design cycle needs the shared vocabulary and principles for domain modeling — goals, drives, tensions, conditional goals, invariants, domain events. Lens-specific depth lives in discovering-actors, modeling-usecases, and mapping-contexts.
