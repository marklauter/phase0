name: reading-usecases
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "read a use case", "review a use case", "check the scenario", "understand the interaction", or when an agent needs to understand the structure of use case files. Loads the structural contract for use case documents.

Read the form at `.claude/modeling-contracts/forms/usecase.md` when you need to verify structure.

## Reading use cases

Use cases live at `use-cases/` within the model directory, with an `index.md` catalog.

- **Start with the index** — `use-cases/index.md` maps each use case to its bounded context and primary actor. Read the index before drilling into individual files.
- **Cross-reference actors** — the Context section names the primary and supporting actors. Read `actors/index.md` to understand who participates and their drives.
- **Scenario is the spine** — the numbered scenario steps tell the story. Each step names the actor and expresses intent. Domain events (marked with `-->`) are the meaningful state transitions.
- **Obstacles branch from steps** — goal obstacles are keyed to scenario steps (e.g., "Step 3a"). Read them as threats to the goal, not alternate flows.
