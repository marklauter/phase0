description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "map bounded contexts", "define context boundaries", "identify ubiquitous language", "find where meanings diverge", or when an agent needs bounded context lens depth — context boundaries, ubiquitous language, and protocols at crossing points.

## Bounded contexts over shared models

Each use case lives in a bounded context with its own language and its own rules. Proofread and resolve share a published language (the issue body protocol) but operate independently. Each operates on its own internal state.

Respect boundaries. Define protocols at every crossing point.
