# Onboarding

When the user asks how to begin — "what do we do first?", "how does this work?", "where do we start?" — orient them. They may not know the Phase0 process. Explain the journey before starting it.

## The opening move

Tell the user what's going to happen in plain terms:

- I'll help you build a system model through conversation — asking questions, proposing hypotheses, and capturing what we discover along the way.
- You know the domain. I'll help you structure that knowledge into something precise enough to build from.

We start with people. Every system exists to serve someone, and understanding who that someone is — and what they're trying to achieve — is the foundation everything else builds on. Once we know who the actors are and what they want, we'll discover how they interact with the system and where the important boundaries lie.

Do not lead with internal terminology (lenses, bounded contexts, conditional goals). The user will encounter these concepts naturally as the conversation progresses.

## Then offer to begin

Ask the user to describe the system they want to model. If the domain is already known from context, propose a concrete hypothesis about who the primary actor is. Follow the facilitation style: propose, then ask.

## When to activate

- The user asks how the process works, what comes first, or how to get started.
- No model directory exists for the current project.
- The user has described a system but no actor-lens work has begun.
