# Wiki Restructuring

**Status:** Not yet designed.

## Purpose

Owns the interactive restructuring of an existing wiki — adding missing pages, removing obsolete pages, reorganizing sections, and updating navigation. Discovered as a gap during [Wiki Creation](01-wiki-creation.md) design: if creators partially fail, the wiki has content so the creation workflow refuses to run, and drift detection is not interactive.

## Ubiquitous language

This section will be populated when the context is designed.

## Use cases

- [Refactor existing wiki](../use-cases/08-refactor-existing-wiki.md) — Interactively restructure an existing wiki *(not yet designed)*.

## Events produced

This section will be populated when the context is designed.

## Events consumed

This section will be populated when the context is designed.

## Integration points

This section will be populated when the context is designed.

## Notes

- This context was discovered as a gap during [Wiki Creation](01-wiki-creation.md) design. The creation workflow assumes an empty wiki. When a wiki has partial content — from a failed creation run, manual edits, or organic growth — a different workflow is needed.
- Design of this context is pending. See [Refactor existing wiki](../use-cases/08-refactor-existing-wiki.md) for the placeholder use case.
