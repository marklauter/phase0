# Commissioning orchestrator

## Category

Supporting actor.

## Role

Coordinates the wiki population workflow — from source code research through plan approval to page creation.

## Description

Named for the *commissioning editor* in publishing — the person who identifies what content is needed, recruits authors, and shepherds manuscripts from concept to completion. The commissioning orchestrator dispatches researchers to comprehend the source code, feeds their reports to the developmental editor, presents the plan for user approval, and dispatches creators to produce pages.

## Drive

Commissioning.

## Abstract parent

[Orchestrator](02-orchestrator.md)

## Separation rationale

The coordination drive shared by all orchestrators is insufficient to protect the User's goal of populating a new wiki — the commissioning drive determines which agents to dispatch (researchers, then developmental editor, then creators), when to pause for user approval of the plan, and when the wiki is complete. This sequencing logic is unique to the creation workflow.

## Notes

- The commissioning orchestrator is the only orchestrator that involves the developmental editor.
- User approval of the wiki plan is a gate between research and content creation.
