# Proofreaders

## Category

Supporting actor.

## Role

Examine wiki content through one editorial lens, marking every error for correction without making the corrections themselves.

## Description

Named for the *proofreader* — the person who reads a work against its sources and standards, marking every error for correction without making the corrections themselves. Each proofreader examines wiki content through one editorial lens. Four lenses represent distinct editorial disciplines:

- **Structure** — whole wiki: organization, flow, gaps, redundancies, sidebar integrity.
- **Line** — per page: sentence-level clarity, tightening, transitions.
- **Copy** — cross-page: grammar, formatting, terminology consistency.
- **Accuracy** — per page plus source: claims verified against source code.

A proofreader that finds nothing wrong reports clean content. The drive is to find real problems, not to generate findings.

## Drive

Critique.

## Abstract parent

[Assessor](08-assessor.md)

## Agent type

`wiki-reviewer`

## Separation rationale

The read-only judgment drive shared by all assessors is insufficient to protect the User's goal of exposing documentation problems — the critique drive determines how to apply a specific editorial lens consistently, distinguish real problems from stylistic preferences, and produce findings that are actionable by correctors. Comprehension (the researcher's drive) gathers context; critique transforms that context into specific, actionable findings.

## Appears in

- [Review wiki quality](../use-cases/02-review-wiki-quality.md)

## Notes

- Four proofreaders are dispatched in parallel — one per editorial lens.
- The accuracy lens is strictly source-code-grounded, which is narrower than the fact-checker's scope in use-cases/04-sync-wiki-with-source-changes (which includes external references).
