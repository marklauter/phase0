# Agent architecture — emerging design

## Roles

### Facilitator (main conversation)

The main conversation in Claude Code terms. Talks to the user. Knows the lenses, knows when to switch, knows when to pull a thread vs queue it. Guides the progression but the user makes the final call. This is the conductor. Shaped by CLAUDE.md and skills — not a subagent.

### Socratic lens agents (3)

One per lens (actor, use case, bounded context). The facilitator delegates to them when deep questioning is needed within a lens. They know their lens's questions cold. They return findings to the facilitator.

### Journal (file convention, not an agent)

In-flight discoveries are captured as timestamped markdown entries in `models/{owner}/{repo}/journal/`. File format: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-slug.md`. Sortable by filesystem, append-only, atomic — one finding or decision per entry.

Any agent or the facilitator can write a journal entry. No dedicated Historian agent needed — it's a Write call and a naming convention. The journal is the scratch queue; stable facts graduate to agent memory or model artifacts.

### Synthesizer

Another agent. Receives accumulated findings (from the historian's notes, or pushed directly by the facilitator) and maps them to artifacts. "This is an actor. This is an invariant. This term needs a glossary entry. This event crosses a boundary." Doesn't write the artifacts — decides *where* each discovery belongs.

### Lens specialists (3)

One per lens. These are writers that need deep interpretive knowledge of their lens to structure findings into artifacts:

- **Use case writer** — use case lens. Structures individual use cases (UC-{id}-{slug}.md). Needs the philosophy and template deeply.
- **Actor cataloger** — actor lens. Maintains the actor catalog (ACTOR-CATALOG.md). Needs to understand goals, drives, tensions, separation rationale.
- **Domain context writer** — bounded context lens. Writes domain context definitions (DC-{id}-{slug}.md) and the domain events catalog. Needs to understand term boundaries, ubiquitous language, event crossing.

### Librarian

A single cross-cutting agent that maintains all reference and catalog artifacts. Its drive is keeping the model's reference artifacts current and consistent.

Carries **artifact contract skills** — one per artifact type. Each contract skill defines the structure of that artifact for both reading and writing. The structure doesn't change depending on direction — a contract is a contract. This means the Librarian doesn't spend tokens guessing how to parse a file it's already written, and any structural drift between artifacts is caught by the contract.

**Artifact contract skills:**

- **Use case contract** — sections, ordering, what each section contains. (Also used by the use case writer lens specialist.)
- **Actor catalog contract** — actor entries, goals/drives, appearance matrix, separation rationale.
- **Use case catalog contract** — index structure, one-line summaries, bounded context mapping.
- **Domain context contract** — purpose, ubiquitous language, use case references, events produced/consumed, integration points.
- **Domain events catalog contract** — what qualifies as a domain event vs internal event, producer/consumer, payload structure.
- **Glossary contract** — one-sentence entries, canonical spelling, when a term outgrows a glossary entry.
- **Shared invariants contract** — the repetition test for promotion from local to shared, cross-cutting rule structure.
- **Design conversations contract** — append-only, informal, capture reasoning behind non-obvious decisions.

## Flow

Two modes, controlled by the user with guidance from the facilitator:

1. **Real-time**: facilitator → lens agent → finding → facilitator decides to push to synthesizer immediately
2. **Batched**: facilitator → lens agent → finding → journal entry written → facilitator continues questioning → later, facilitator pushes accumulated journal entries to synthesizer

## Implementation status

The `designing-usecases` agent (`.claude/agents/designing-usecases.md`) is the first implementation. It combines the use case lens Socratic interviewer and use case writer into a single agent — will split as the architecture matures. Preloads four skills: `modeling-philosophy`, `modeling-usecases`, `structuring-usecases`, `writing-documentation`.

## Open questions

- Do lens specialists share artifact contract skills with the Librarian? (e.g., the use case writer and the Librarian both need the use case contract.)
- Where does the Librarian's work get triggered — by the synthesizer, the facilitator, or both?
