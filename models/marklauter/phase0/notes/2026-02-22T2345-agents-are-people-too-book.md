# New book: Agents are People Too — the story behind Phase0

## Context

Mark is writing a book about the ideas and journey behind Phase0.

## Body

The book is titled "Agents are People Too — the story behind Phase0." It tells the story of how Phase0 emerged from the insight that AI agents, like people, perform best when given clear goals, well-defined roles, and structured collaboration. The narrative threads together goal-directed design (Cooper), domain-driven design (Evans), and the discovery that agentic AI systems benefit from the same modeling rigor we apply to human organizations.
