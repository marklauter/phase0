# Effective knowledge graphs are layered

## Context

Surfaced during reflection on how knowledge graph structure supports both human and agent consumption.

## Body

Effective knowledge graphs are layered. This is how abstractions are built — each layer captures a different level of detail or concern, and a human or agent accesses the relevant layer of information when needed. The layering principle means that no single consumer must parse the entire graph; instead, they navigate to the abstraction level that serves their current task. This mirrors how well-designed systems expose coarse-grained interfaces at higher layers while preserving fine-grained detail beneath.
