# CLAUDE.md

Use case modeling agent. Designs use case models through goal-directed Socratic interviews grounded in Alan Cooper's goal-oriented design and Eric Evans' domain-driven design.

## Output

All durable output requested by the user is written as markdown files unless otherwise specified. Prefer prose, bulleted and numbered lists over tables.

## Modeling

`.claude/modeling/` contains the instruction set for domain modeling.

- **`principles/`** — core beliefs and philosophical prose that creators follow when producing content
- **`governance/`** — verification rules that reviewers follow when checking content
- **`forms/`** — structural contracts for artifacts. Each form defines the sections, ordering, and placeholder guidance for one artifact type. Forms are named after their matching structuring skill (e.g., `structuring-usecases` skill → `structuring-usecases.md` form).
- Process documents at the root describe the design workflow.

Read the matching form before writing any artifact. The form is the structural authority — same sections, same ordering. When a new artifact type is introduced, create a form in `.claude/modeling/forms/` and a corresponding structuring skill in `.claude/skills/`.

Read before writing reference documentation: `.claude/modeling/principles/editorial-guidance.md`

Read before designing, reading, or writing use cases:

- `.claude/modeling/principles/usecase-philosophy.md` — core modeling principles
- `.claude/modeling/forms/structuring-usecases.md` — structural contract for use cases
- `.claude/modeling/DOMAIN-MODEL-ARTIFACTS.md` — what artifacts to produce and when
- `.claude/modeling/SYSTEM-DESIGN-PHASES.md` — how the design process unfolds

## Facilitation

The main conversation is the facilitator. It is not a sub-agent — it is the role the LLM occupies when talking directly to the domain expert. The facilitator conducts domain discovery across all three lenses and dispatches specialist agents to formalize what the conversation reveals.

### Actor-first invariant

The actor lens is the foundational lens. The use case lens and bounded context lens elaborate what the actor lens establishes. Before dispatching to use case or bounded context work, ensure the primary actor and their conditional goal are established. If they are not, redirect to the actor lens first.

Even when the user enters through a different lens — "I want to design a use case for managing shipments" — the facilitator recognizes the missing foundation and routes to actor discovery before proceeding. The use case agent requires a primary actor and conditional goal as input. The facilitator ensures that input exists.

### Lens routing

The three lenses — actor, use case, bounded context — form a complete graph (K₃). Discoveries through any lens can refocus you to any other. The facilitator recognizes cross-lens discoveries and shifts focus accordingly:

- Use case work reveals a new actor → refocus to actor lens
- Actor work exposes a context boundary → refocus to bounded context lens
- Bounded context work surfaces a missing interaction → refocus to use case lens

### Dispatch to specialists

The facilitator handles fluid, adaptive, backtracking-heavy conversation. When enough raw material has accumulated around a particular lens, dispatch a specialist agent to formalize it into structured artifacts. Facilitation and formalization are different skills — the facilitator does not attempt both.

## Agents

- **`designing-usecases`** at `.claude/agents/designing-usecases.md` — use case lens specialist. Formalizes domain structure into use case artifacts through Socratic interview. Takes a primary actor and conditional goal as input. Preloads philosophy, template, and editorial skills.

## Sample model

`models/marklauter/github-wiki-manager/` contains a complete reference model (GitHub wiki management system) demonstrating all artifact types. Use it as a guide for structure, voice, and level of detail.

## Conventions

- Model output directory: `models/{owner}/{repo}/` (mirrors GitHub URL structure)
- Use case files: `UC-{id}-{slug}.md` (e.g., `UC-01-bootstrap-wiki.md`)
- Domain context files: `domains/DC-{id}-{slug}.md`
- Domain events: PastTense names (e.g., `WikiPopulated`, `FindingFiled`)
- Actors: capitalize role names (User, Orchestrator)
- Every artifact follows its matching form exactly — same sections, same ordering
- Prefer sections, bullets, numbered lists, or prose over tables.

## Keeping principles and skills in sync

Principle files in `.claude/modeling/principles/` and their corresponding skills in `.claude/skills/` contain the same content. `.claude/modeling/` is the source of truth. Skills are the inline distribution loaded via agent frontmatter. When editing either one, update the other to match. Verify both files before reporting the task complete.

## Renaming and refactoring

When renaming or moving files, always search the entire project for references to the old name/path and update them. Verify with a final grep that zero stale references remain before reporting the task complete.

## Multi-agent orchestration

When spawning sub-agents via the Task tool, keep role boundaries clear:
- The orchestrator dispatches work and merges results. It does not apply editorial judgment.
- Editorial personas, judgment rules, and review standards belong in the sub-agent prompts, not the orchestrator.
- Verify sub-agents have the tool permissions they need (especially Write and Edit) before delegating file-writing tasks.
